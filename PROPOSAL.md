Endless Ecosystem Creative Proposal
Project: AI-Assisted DeFi UX Optimizer for Endless
1. Background & Problem
Endless provides powerful modular infrastructure, wallet support, and developer tooling.
However, for everyday users and new builders, DeFi interactions remain complex, fragmented, and unintuitive.
Key problems:
Users struggle to understand slippage, gas behavior, and transaction outcomes
No assistant exists to explain or optimize DeFi actions before execution
UX friction reduces adoption despite strong backend infrastructure
2. Proposed Solution
We propose an AI-Assisted DeFi UX Optimizer built on Endless.
This tool:
Analyzes DeFi transactions before execution
Explains outcomes in simple language
Warns users about high slippage, failed swaps, or inefficient routes
Suggests optimized transaction parameters
The optimizer integrates directly with the Endless Wallet and ecosystem tools.
3. Why This Matters to Endless
This project:
Improves user retention and onboarding
Reduces failed or confusing transactions
Demonstrates Endless’s AI + modular ecosystem strengths
Serves as a foundation for future wallet-level intelligence
4. Technical Overview
Frontend
React + TypeScript
Endless Wallet Adapter
Logic Layer
Transaction simulation module
AI decision engine (off-chain prototype)
Integration
Endless Wallet
Endless-supported swap and bridge flows
5. Prototype & Demo Plan
The demo includes:
UI mock flow showing transaction analysis
Simulated swap optimization
Wallet-connected test transaction
Public GitHub repository with documentation
6. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: UX flow & wallet integration
Phase 2: Transaction simulation logic
Phase 3: AI suggestion engine
Phase 4: Testing and demo deployment
7. Value to the Ecosystem
This project enhances:
Wallet usability
Developer extensibility
End-user confidence in DeFi actions
8. Ownership & Integrity
This work is original and created solely for the Endless Creative Proposal Competition
